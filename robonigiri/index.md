# RobOnigiri's homepage

This website documents the full process we went through on our goal to build a simple onigiri snack maker!


## What is Onigiri?

Onigiri are triangles of rice, often wrapped in seaweed, and sometimes contain filling (such as tuna, salmon) or toppings (like seaweed flakes, sesame seeds).

## Our goals

Our main goal for this project was to create a device that can shape a pre-measured ball of rice into a triangle, as this is the basis for onigiri.

We did have some stretch goals which included:
- Adding seaweed to the rice
- Auto-weigh and dispense the rice
- Add a seaweed dispenser
- Add filling to the onigiri
- Packgage the onigiri
