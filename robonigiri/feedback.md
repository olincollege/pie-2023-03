After each of the sprint reviews, we had a google form linked which we used to
gather feedback from our peers and CAs/Instructors. This was a really beneficial
process which allowed us to think about our design from the perspective of a
potential customer and gave us ideas on how to iterate.

Feel free to leave us some feedback on our website or our onigiri maker with the
form below and check out this page to see if your question was answered!
